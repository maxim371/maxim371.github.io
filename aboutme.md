Hi, I'm Maxwell Kwarteng, a data scientist focused on helping tech startups and professional service firms understand their customers and recommend the right decisions. To do this, I specialize in recommender systems, natural language processing, and deploying machine learning models with user interfaces.

Studying finance taught me to analyze time series data.I have always had the passion for analyzing data and communicating results. I'd love to work with you to solve business problems using math and code.

### Deploying Models
I prototype in Jupyter notebook, with pandas to wrangle,matplotlib to visualize, and scikit-learn to model. Then i deploy interactive web apps to make models useful.

### Natural Language Processing
I'm experienced scraping, processing, and analyzing structured and unstructured data with python

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
